# Holy Eucharist

## Confession

Let us humbly confess our sins before Almighty God.

> Almighty and most merciful Father,
>> we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.
> We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts.
>> We have offended against your holy laws.
> We have left undone those things which we ought to have done,
>> and we have done those things which we ought not to have done;
>> and apart from your grace, there is no health in us.
> O Lord, have mercy upon us.
> Spare all those who confess their faults.
> Restore all those who are penitent, according to your promises
>> declared to all people in Christ Jesus our Lord.
> And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,
>> that we may now live a godly, righteous, and sober life,
>> to the glory of your holy Name.
> Amen.

## Thanksgiving

<>
The Lord be with you.
**And also with you.**
Lift up your hearts.
**We lift them to the Lord.**
Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
**It is right to give him thanks and praise.**
</>

It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and every- where to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord, God of power and might, heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.

On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me."

After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, "Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me."

As our Lord has taught us to pray
So we are bold to say:
</>

> Our Father who art in heaven,
>> hallowed be thy Name,
>> thy kingdom come,
>> thy will be done,
>>> on earth as it is in heaven.
> Give us this day our daily bread,
> And forgive us our trespasses,
>> as we forgive those who trespass against us,
> And lead us not into temptation,
>> but deliver us from evil.
> For thine is the kingdom,
> and the power,
> and the glory,
> for ever and ever.
> Amen.

<>
Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us;
**Therefore let us keep the feast.**
</>

> O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
>> have mercy upon us.
> O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
>> have mercy upon us.
> O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
>> grant us thy peace.

## Humble Access

We do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lord, trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy Table. But thou art the same Lord whose property is always to have mercy. Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink his blood, that we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us. Amen.

The gifts of God for the people of God.
Take them in remembrance that Christ died for you, and feed on him in your hearts by faith, with thanksgiving.
